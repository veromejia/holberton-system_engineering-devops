## Web infrastructure design

### 0. Simple web stack

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

Requirements:

You must use:
1 server
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)
1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

### 1. Distributed web infrastructure

On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

You must add:
2 servers
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
1 set of application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL)

### 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure

On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

Requirements:

You must add:
3 firewalls
1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)


### 3. Scale up #advanced

Requirements:

You must add:
1 server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server
